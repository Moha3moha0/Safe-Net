        talk to Someone

    <p>The internet gives us the power to control what we see and who can contact us. If someone is bullying you online, you don’t have to keep reading their messages. Block them. It’s quick and easy. Then report them to the platform or talk to a trusted adult. You’re not weak for asking for help — you’re smart. Taking action keeps you safe and also protects others who might be targeted next. You deserve to be online without fear.</p>
